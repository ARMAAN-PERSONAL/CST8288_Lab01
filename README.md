Java Employee Management System (Lab 1)
This project implements an Employee Management System (EMS) as part of Lab 1 for CST8288 at Algonquin College. The system demonstrates the use of Singleton, Builder, and Factory design patterns, focusing on efficient employee management and object-oriented design principles.

The Employee Management System manages employees with various attributes such as:
Employee ID
Name
Department
Role
Working Hours Per Week
Salary

This system allows operations such as:
Clocking In/Out
Tracking Work Hours
Managing Employee Details
Design Patterns

This project demonstrates the following design patterns:
Singleton Pattern: Ensures a single instance of the EmployeeManager class to manage all employees.
Builder Pattern: Constructs complex employee objects (e.g., FullTimeEmployee, PartTimeEmployee) with various attributes.
Factory Pattern: Creates employee objects based on their type (e.g., EmployeeFactory creates FullTimeEmployee and PartTimeEmployee objects).
